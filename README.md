# WooCommerce SubOrdenator

**Plugin by [Studio Rude Box](https://studiorudebox.nl)**  
Easily link WooCommerce orders together by assigning suborders to a main order — for a cleaner, more organized order management system in WP-Admin.

## 🧩 What is WooCommerce SubOrdenator?

The **WooCommerce SubOrdenator** plugin adds functionality to the WordPress Admin that allows store owners to link one order to another. This creates a clear parent–child relationship between orders: a *main order* and one or more *suborders*.

It’s ideal for workflows where:
- Multiple orders belong to the same transaction or customer journey.
- You want to group related orders for clarity or reporting purposes.
- You need to track dependencies between orders (e.g., separate shipments or partial fulfillment).

## 🔧 Features

- Add a **"Main Order ID"** field to any order in the WooCommerce Admin.
- View **suborder relationships** directly in the order overview table.
- Icons indicate whether an order is a main order 📦 or a suborder ➡️.
- Includes a **filter** above the order list to quickly view only main orders or only suborders.
- Supports quick access to the linked main order from any suborder.

## 💡 How it works

Once the plugin is activated:
1. Go to any WooCommerce order in the admin panel.
2. Enter the ID of the main order in the "Main Order ID" field.
3. Save the order — the relationship is now established.

In the order overview:
- A new column shows the linked main order for suborders.
- A filter at the top allows you to show only main or suborders.
- Icons help you quickly recognize which type of order you're viewing.
